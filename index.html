                        <h4>Multiple pages</h4>
                        <p>I introduced multiple pages on this hompage instead of putting everything on one page. This would make it very hard to keep the overview and it's even more fancy having own pages for new elements.</p>

                        <h4>Navigation Bar</h4>
                        <p>What would we do with a Homepage that has multiple pages but no navigation bar? You nailed it. We would get lost. So there also is a navigation bar at the left hand side, now.</p>

                        <h4>The Kudu Counter moved</h4>
                        <p>The Kudu Counter got it's own page, since I've introduced multiple pages. It is the first element having an individual page. Congratulations to the Kudu Counter. Try to find it via the navigation bar.</p>
